# Hagit commit -m"ngman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

Description
The Hangman project is a Python implementation of the classic word guessing game. The computer selects a random word from a list, and the player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game keeps track of lives, guessed letters, and informs the player whether their guesses are correct.

Features
Random word selection from a predefined list.
A user-friendly interface for guessing letters.
Tracks the player's guesses, lives, and displays the progress of the hidden word.
Provides feedback on correct/incorrect guesses and tracks repeated guesses.
Displays messages for winning or losing the game.
Aim of the Project
The project aims to demonstrate and practice fundamental Python programming skills, including:

Control structures (loops, conditionals)
String manipulation
Handling lists and sets
Taking user input and giving feedback
Implementing basic game logic using object-oriented programming (OOP)
What You Will Learn
By working on this project, you will:

Improve your understanding of Python syntax.
Learn how to design and implement a basic word game using algorithms.
Handle user input and error handling effectively.
Gain experience with classes and objects in Python.
Installation
To run the Hangman game on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd hangman
Ensure that Python 3.6+ is installed on your system. You can download Python from python.org.

Usage
To play the game:

Run the following command:

python hangman.py
The game will display a hidden word represented by underscores (_) and will prompt you to guess one letter at a time. The game will inform you whether your guess is correct and will display the progress of the hidden word.

You have a limited number of lives (5 by default). If you guess the word before running out of lives, you win. If you lose all your lives, you lose the game.

The game will also notify you if you repeat a guess, and will only accept valid single alphabetical characters as input.
