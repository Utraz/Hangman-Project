Description
The Hangman project is a classic word guessing game implemented in Python. The aim of the project is to create a simple, yet fun and interactive game where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

Features:
Random word selection from a predefined list.
User-friendly interface for guessing letters.
Tracks the number of incorrect guesses and displays the hangman status.
Informative messages for win/loss scenarios.
Aim of the Project:
The main aim of this project is to practice and demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, particularly in areas such as:

Control structures (loops, conditionals)
String manipulation
List handling
User input and output
Basic game logic implementation
What You Will Learn:
By working on this project, you will enhance your understanding of:

Python syntax and semantics
Designing simple algorithms for game logic
Handling user input and providing real-time feedback
Basic error handling and validation
Installation
To run the Hangman game on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd hangman
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.6+). You can download it from python.org.
Usage
To play the game, simply run the hangman.py script:


python hangman.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to start guessing letters. The game will display the current state of the word, the letters you have guessed, and the number of attempts remaining.
